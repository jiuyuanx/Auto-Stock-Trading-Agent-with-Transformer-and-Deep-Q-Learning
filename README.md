Python Notebooks:
    1. StockPredictionTransformer_LongSequences - This contains code for how to use Transformer Netwrok to generate predictions for AAPL
    1. StockPredictionTransformer_Multiple - This contains code for the Transformer Netwrok which generates future stock prices to be fed into the Deep-Q Network.
    2. CNN+Double_DQN - This contains code for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent which performs actions on the generated stock prices and its incurred profit.
